There are 3 domains, each one with 2 nodes
Each domain has a different backup policy:
- DomainA: backup on every node
- DomainB: backup in only one node
- DomainC: alaways backup in a node. Other node backup only if topic is about 'science'

One producer (JSONGenerator) sends JSON documents to a fanout exchange (but also with a binding key)
• Three domain managers ManagerA, ManagerB, and ManagerC consume messages from the same exchange...and then produce another message towards their domain workers
• ManagerA publishes to a DomainA fanout
• two publish/subscribe domain workers
• ManagerB publishes to a DomainB work queue
• two work queue domain workers
• ManagerC publishes to a DomainC topic, based on received binding key gathered via method.routing_key
• one domain worker subscribing to "#"
• one domain worker subscribing to "science"
